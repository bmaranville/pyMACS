Data 
========================

This object contains data operations for both of the results of simulations. It includes input/ouput operations to 
external files like .csv and .ng0 files, as well as a pandas interface named the data matrix. It also provides 
limited visualization tools that act as a simplified version of MSlice. Finally, all of these operations 
can be performed in imported real MACS ng0 files as well.
