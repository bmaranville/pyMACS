Note from TH: If you want to actually plot the calculated resolution ellipsoids, please contact me for the relevant csv files. They are too large to host indefinitely, but if you ask I can send them and the script should work if you use place the relevant files in the "ellipsoid_csv_files" directory here. Then, calc_mode="default" will include images of the actual monte-carlo calculated ellipsoid.
